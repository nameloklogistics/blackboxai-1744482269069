# Logistics Blockchain

## Project Overview

Logistics Blockchain is a blockchain-based platform designed to streamline and enhance logistics operations. This platform leverages the capabilities of blockchain technology to provide secure, transparent, and tamper-proof logistics services, improving traceability and efficiency.

## Installation

To get started with Logistics Blockchain, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logistics-blockchain.git
cd logistics-blockchain
npm install
```

### Using Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can run the project using Docker:

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
2. Build and start the services using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start both the API and the MongoDB service.

## Usage

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

For development, you can use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command uses `nodemon` to automatically restart the server when file changes are detected.

### Accessing the API

Once the server is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- Blockchain-based architecture for logistics operations.
- Integration with Hyperledger Fabric for secure transaction processing.
- RESTful API endpoints for interacting with logistics data.
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests.
- Logging using Winston for better debugging and information tracking.
- Automated testing with Jest.

## Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies defined in the `package.json` file:

- `express`: Web framework for Node.js.
- `fabric-network`: Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Node.js.
- `fabric-ca-client`: Client for Hyperledger Fabric Certificate Authority.
- `cors`: Package to enable CORS.
- `dotenv`: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `winston`: Logger for Node.js.
- `ws`: WebSocket library.
- `jsonwebtoken`: Implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure API authentication.
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool.

For development purposes, the following devDependencies are included:

- `nodemon`: Tool that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the server.
- `jest`: JavaScript testing framework.
- `eslint`: Tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- `prettier`: Opinionated code formatter.
- `supertest`: SuperAgent driven library for testing HTTP servers.
